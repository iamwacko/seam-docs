# Connect A Device
Before you can control a device, that owner of that device must first authorize your application. The owner may be you, or one of your application's users.

To do so, Seam provides [Connect Views](../core_concepts/connect_views.md). It's a fully managed UI-flow, guiding your user through device selection and authorization.
