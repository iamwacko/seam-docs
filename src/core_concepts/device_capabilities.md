# Device Capabilities

Seam decomposes the ensemble of features offered by a device into capabilities. In other words, a device capability encapsulates **a feature or function of a device**. [^note]

[^note]: This device interaction model leans heavily on the wonderful work done by [W3C WoT](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#sec-interaction-model).

A device can have one or more capabilities describing what you can do with it. 

For example, a battery-powered door lock with a pin-pad such as Yale Assure would have the `lock`, `access_codes`, and `battery` capabilities.

Seam exposes each capability as a set of APIs. Furthermore, those APIs are standardized across brands for ease of integration.

## Capabilities -> Actions, Properties, and Events
Each device capability decomposes into 3 sets of affordances: 

- **Actions** -- things you can do to it.
- **Properties** -- the current state of the device.
- **Events** -- reports from the device describing state transitions.

For example, the `lock` capability decomposes in the following manner:

- **Actions:** `UNLOCK` and `LOCK`
- **Properties:**  a `locked` status to determine the lock's current status
- **Events:** a list of lock/unlock events logging all of the lock's transitions.

## Standardizing Capabilities Across Device Brands
The Seam API standardizes capabilities across brands. For example, an unlock action on a door lock always requires the same API call. This is irrespective of whether the lock brand is a Yale, August, Schlage...etc.

However, a perfectly uniform interface is not always possible. 

For example, some door locks with the `access_codes` capability require different pin-code length. Some locks require 5 digits. Others require 4 to 8.

In those instances, we attempt to handle these differences for you. For example, we will generate and set a pin code of the appropriate length. However, you may wish to set your own code. We let you do so, but it must meet the constraints set by the device.
